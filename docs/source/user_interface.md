# User Interface
PyProp is accessed as a Python module.

```python
import pyprop

opt = pyprop.Optimizer()
...
```

## Units
PyProp allows the user to specify the units for each value if they desire. For float values, this is done by making the value a list where the first element is the actual value and the second element is a string specifying the units. For example:

    "area" : [6.75, "ft^2"]

For vector inputs, such as position and velocity, the units are simply appended to the vector:

    "velocity" : [100.0, 13.0, 0.0, "ft/s"]

For array inputs, such as a chord distribution, the units are appended as another row in the array:

    "chord" : [[0.0, 1.225],
             [0.5, 1.0066],
             [1.0, 0.81935],
             ["-", "in"]]

When specifying column units in files, these are also appended as another row:

    # File: chord.csv
    0.0, 1.225
    0.5, 1.0066
    1.0, 0.81935
    "-", "in"

The following measurements can be defined with the accompanying units:

| Measurement                   | Acceptable Units                  |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Position/displacement/length: | "ft", "m", "in", "cm"             |
| Area:                         | "ft^2", "m^2"                     |
| Velocity:                     | "ft/s", "m/s", "mph", "kph", "kn" |
| Angular deflection/position:  | "deg", "rad"                      |
| Angular rate:                 | "rpm", "deg/s", "rad/s"           |
| Density:                      | "slug/ft^3", "kg/m^3"             |
| Weight/Force:                 | "lbf", "N", "oz"                  |
| Torque:                       | "ft lbf", "Nm"                    |
| Power:                        | "lbf ft/s", "W", "hp"             |
| Mass:                         | "slug", "kg", "lbm", "g"          |
| Power to weight ratio:        | "ft/s", "m/s", "W/lbf"            |

*Units must be given exactly as they appear in this table. Otherwise, PyProp will not recognize the unit specification.*

*Note that for power to weight ratio, "ft/s" is equivalent to "(lbf ft/s)/lbf" and "m/s" is equivalent to "W/N".*

**The distinction between units of weight and units of mass is strictly adhered to within PyProp. Please make sure you know when to use which.**

Except for angular measurements, the first unit listed is the default for "English" units. The second is the default for "SI". The default for angular rates is always "rpm". For airfoil parameters, measurements may only be expressed in radians. When specifying units in an array and one of the measurements is dimensionless (e.g. span fraction), "-" should be used. Any results generated by PyProp will be output in the default unit for the given system, regardless of how units were specified for the inputs.
