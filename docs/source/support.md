# Support

Unlike previous versions of MachUp, MachUpX is in active development, and we encourage users to submit bug reports on the Github repo. We will continually push bug fixes to the 'master' branch. Suggested improvements are also welcome but will be developed in separate branches. When a new version is ready to be released, we will merge all developed improvements into the 'master' branch.

For questions, please contact [doug.hunsaker@usu.edu](doug.hunsaker@usu.edu) or [cory.goates@aggiemail.usu.edu](cory.goates@aggiemail.usu.edu).
