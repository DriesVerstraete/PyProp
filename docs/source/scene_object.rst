Scene Class
===========

The machupX module is imported through the Python interpreter. All functionality of MachUpX is available through the Scene class. The Scene class takes a file or a Python dictionary containing the configuration information described in 'Input Files'. Various member functions of Scene can then be called to perform analyses on the aircraft in the scene. Please note that all available functionality for MachUpX is accessed through the Scene class. Accessing lower-level classes and members directly may cause unpredictable and undesired behavior.
