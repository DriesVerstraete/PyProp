1|If you prefer a printed manual, there is a printable version (about 115 pages) in Adobe PDF format on the MotoCalc CD in the file "MotoCalc.pdf". This document is also available on the MotoCalc web site at http://www.motocalc.com/motocalc.pdf. You can download the free Adobe reader from http://www.adobe.com and print it on your own printer, or take it to a copy shop to have it printed (refer to the permission notice in the manual).
907|You can use the MotoWizard to make power system suggestions based on components that you have on hand. By clicking on "Specific Motor", "Specific Gear Ratio", "Specific Size", or "Specific Battery" in the "Motor", "Gear && Prop", or "Battery" tabs of the MotoWizard, you can specify exactly which components you want to use, and let the wizard choose the rest.
38|By clicking the "Compare" button at the bottom of a Static or In-flight Analysis, the result is added to the side-by-side Comparison window where you can compare up to 10 power systems at a glance. You can remove columns from the Comparison window by clicking the [x] at the top of the columns you want to remove.
26|It's easy to add a plane to the Airframe database. Enter the name, wing span, wing area, and empty weight (weight without power system) in the Airframe section of the MotoCalc Project window. Then click the "Coeff" button and fill in the choices on the right hand side of the Coefficient Estimator window. Click the "From Measurements" button to enter measurements from the plan or actual model. Finally, close the Measurements and Estimator windows, and click "Save" in the Airframe section of the MotoCalc Project window.
911|New data is being added to MotoCalc's databases all the time. To make sure you have the latest data, select "Update All" from the "Update" menu. You can also get data contributed by other users by clicking "Get Contributed Data" on the "Update" menu.
2327|MotoCalc can predict the performance of multiple motors driving a single propeller through a multi-motor gearbox. Just fill in the "Series Motors" and "Parallel Motors" fields to indicate how your motors are wired (or use the Wiring Wizard), and then type "1" in the "Num Props" field (all of these fields are in the Drive System section).
38|In the Comparison window, you can re-order the columns by just clicking on the column headings, and dragging them to where you want them relative to the other columns, just like in a spreadsheet.
8|When you open one of MotoCalc's component browsers (by clicking Open in a section of the MotoCalc Workbench), the items are initially sorted alphabetically by name (motor names all begin with the manufacturer's name, such as Model Motors for the AXI out-runners). You can click on the column headings to sort by that column (for example, cell capacity).
81|In MotoCalc's component browsers (such as the Motor Browser), you can type something in the "Find" field to quickly locate what you're looking for. By clicking the arrow buttons next to the "Find" field, you can jump to the next or previous matching item.
89|If you want to find a motor (or speed control, cell type, etc.) that is similar to another one, select one in the appropriate component browser (e.g. the Motor Browser), and then click the "Similar" button. The table will be rearranged with the selected item at the top, and the most similar items immediately below it.
36|Once you've used the MotoCalc Workbench to produce a static or in-flight analysis, you can click the "Opinion" button to generate a MotOpinion report. This will tell you, in plain English, how your plane will perform with the selected power system. If there are problems, it will tell you, and make suggestions on how to correct them.
44|You can easily share any of your MotoCalc projects with another MotoCalc user. Just select "Copy Project" from the "Projects" menu, and then paste that into an e-mail to your fellow hobbyist. If you receive such an e-mail, choose "Select All" in your e-mail reader, go to MotoCalc, and select "Paste Project" from the "Projects" menu. If only it were this easy to share your real workbench!
213|If the motor you want to make predictions for is not in MotoCalc's database, there are a number of ways you can determine the required constants. One is by measuring them directly. You can also derive them from manufacturer provided catalog data, published test data, or by approximating them based on known constants for an identical motor with a different number of winds. Click "Tell Me More" below for details on all of these methods.
25|The "Filter" section is a very useful part of the MotoCalc Workbench. Using the fields in this section, you can place restrictions on the power systems you want to generate predictions for, such as maximum current, minimum run time, or minimum thrust (use the scroll bar to see all the possible restrictions). When using large ranges of cell count, propeller sizes, and gear ratios, this can quickly eliminate a lot of useless set-ups.
203|Electric models perform extremely well at high altitudes. If you fly at a high altitude or in extremely hot or cold weather, set your flying field condtions in the "Options" window so MotoCalc can automatically adjust for the resulting change in air density.
20|MotoCalc is very customizable via the "Options" window (click "Options" on the main menu). You can specify the measurement units you prefer (US, Metric, or a mix of the two), flying field conditions, which columns you want to see on reports, and a variety of other preferences.
32|Most of MotoCalcs reports (static and in-flight analyses, and MotOpinion) can be saved in a variety of formats. Plain text is suitable for e-mailing. HTML looks more like the original report (complete with colour coding) and is great for use on your web site. CSV format (for predictions) and RTF (for MotOpinon) are compatible with most "office" suites, like OpenOffice or Microsoft Office.
10|A picture is worth a thousand words. MotoCalc can produce graphs from both static and in-flight analyses. On the graph, you can plot any two columns against any other (for example, thrust and drag versus airspeed, or motor efficiency versus number of cells). You can also save your graphs as JPEG or BMP images for future reference.
4|The MotoCalc Workbench is based on the concept of a "Project". A project consists of a motor, a battery (with possibly varying numbers of cells), an optional filter, a drive system (with possibly varying gear ratios and/or propeller sizes), a speed control, and an airframe. When you save a project, MotoCalc remembers the components it consists of, and reloads them when you reopen the project.
93|There are many ways to wire a multi-motored plane, and it can get confusing depending on the types of motors (brushed or brushless) and speed controls (battery eliminator or not). The Wiring Wizard can draw a wiring diagram to make it all make sense, including where to install the fuse(s). You can then print your diagram as a handy reference to use in the workshop.
26|MotoCalc can be used to predict the performance of biplanes. Everything is done the same way as for any other plane, except for the following: In the Wing Span field of the Airframe section, enter the average span of the two wings. In the Wing Area field, enter the total wing area of both wings. This will cause MotoCalc to think you have a plane with one very low aspect ratio wing, which will closely approximate the lift and drag characteristics of the biplane, with its two medium aspect ratio wings and four wing tips.
57|If you have a question about MotoCalc or a suggestion for improvement, you can use the "E-mail Technical Support..." command on the "Help" menu to send us a message.
37|In the Static and In-flight Analysis report windows, you can click the secondary mouse button (the right button on a right-handed mouse) on any row of the report to access a pop-up menu of useful commands, such as copying that row to the clipboard. On a Static Analysis, the menu includes commands to generate an In-flight Analysis or MotOpinion report, or to add the selected set-up to the Comparison window.
2|If you already have a good idea of the power system components you want to use in your model, you may want to skip using the MotoWizard and go straight to the MotoCalc Workbench. There you can select motors, cells, gear boxes, propellers, and speed controls and make predictions about how these will perform in your airplane.
